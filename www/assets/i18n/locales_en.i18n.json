The open source project allows for file transfers between host computers and receiving devices through a UNIX/Windows operating system installed on the host machine. Users can join an existing room or create a new one through the project's website, and then connect to the host computer using a desktop application. Once logged in, both mobile and desktop hosts in the room can engage in two-way file transfers with the host computer. The main objective of the project is to enable fast file transfers using the HTTP protocol through a web application provided by the host computer on the same private network. The project also aims to provide experience in continuous development and integration processes for cross-platform technologies used in the project.",
